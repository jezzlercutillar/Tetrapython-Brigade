# **Calculator-Logic**

#### **SKL** 
```
What you will see in this branch is our calculator's logic.This branch contains two 
Python files that you can download. The first Python file is Logic.py, which contains 
the logic for our calculator, and the second Python file  is test.py. 
In test.py, we will verify that our code performs properly and contains no madapaking errors.
```

#### **Who is in charge of the calculator's logic?**
```
Jiego and Lianbert are given the responsibility of writing the calculator's logic. 
It is also possible for the handsome leader of Tetrapython-Brigade and the two attractive 
boys assigned to this branch to contribute to the development of unit tests 
to ensure that the calculator logic functions properly.
